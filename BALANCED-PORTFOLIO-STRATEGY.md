## Recommended Portfolio Allocation

### Core Holdings (4-Fund Approach)

| Asset Class | ETF | Ticker | MER | Allocation | Rationale |
|-------------|-----|--------|-----|------------|-----------|
| **US Equity** | Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF | VFV | 0.09% | 40% | Core holding - largest, most stable economy |
| **Canadian Equity** | Vanguard FTSE Canada All Cap Index ETF | VCN | 0.06% | 25% | Home country bias, tax efficiency on dividends |
| **International Equity** | Vanguard FTSE Developed All Cap ex North America Index ETF | VIU | 0.23% | 25% | Geographic diversification (Europe, Asia, Pacific) |
| **Fixed Income** | Vanguard Canadian Aggregate Bond Index ETF | VAB | 0.09% | 10% | Stability and downside protection |

**Weighted Average MER: ~0.12%**

## Why This Portfolio?

### 1. **Alignment with Bogle Philosophy**

Jack Bogle's core principles:
- ✅ **Low costs**: Average MER of 0.12% vs 2%+ for actively managed funds
- ✅ **Broad diversification**: ~8,000+ companies across 50+ countries
- ✅ **Market returns**: Tracks market performance rather than trying to beat it
- ✅ **Simplicity**: 4 ETFs provide complete global exposure
- ✅ **Long-term focus**: Buy and hold strategy minimizes trading costs

### 2. **VFV as the Centerpiece**

**Why VFV?**
- Tracks the S&P 500 (500 largest US companies)
- 0.09% MER - one of the lowest-cost S&P 500 ETFs in Canada
- US market is ~60% of global market cap
- Currency diversification (USD exposure)
- Historical returns: ~10% annually over long periods
- Holdings include: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Berkshire Hathaway

**40% allocation rationale:**
- Large enough to drive portfolio returns
- Not so large that US market dominates entirely
- Balances home bias with global opportunity

### 3. **Geographic Diversification**

**90% Equity Split:**
- 44% US (VFV)
- 28% Canada (VCN)
- 28% International (VIU)

This provides exposure to:
- **Different economic cycles**: When one region underperforms, others may thrive
- **Currency diversification**: Reduces CAD concentration risk
- **Sector balance**: Different regions have different sector weightings
- **Political/regulatory diversification**: Spreads geopolitical risk

### 4. **The 10% Bond Component (VAB)**

**Why include bonds in a growth portfolio?**
- **Volatility reduction**: Cushions equity downturns
- **Portfolio rebalancing opportunities**: Sell bonds to buy equities during crashes
- **Income generation**: Steady interest payments
- **Sleep-at-night factor**: Psychological comfort during market stress

**Why only 10%?**
- Moderate risk tolerance allows for higher equity exposure
- Long time horizon (10+ years) favors growth
- Current low interest rate environment reduces bond appeal
- Can be increased as you approach retirement

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Choose Your Platform

**Recommended: Questrade**
- **Commission-free ETF purchases** (only pay on sales: $4.95-$9.95)
- No account minimums
- Full control over investments
- Mobile app available
- Partnership with many Canadian banks (including ATB Financial)

**Alternative: National Bank Direct Brokerage**
- Also offers commission-free ETF purchases
- Good if you're already a National Bank customer

### Step 2: Initial Purchase

**For $10,000 investment:**
- VFV: $4,000 (40%)
- VCN: $2,500 (25%)
- VIU: $2,500 (25%)
- VAB: $1,000 (10%)

**Important Notes:**
- All 4 ETFs trade in CAD on the TSX - no currency conversion fees
- Purchase all at once to avoid market timing
- Set up dividend reinvestment (DRIP) for automatic compounding

### Step 3: Ongoing Contributions

**Dollar-Cost Averaging:**
1. Set up automatic transfers (e.g., $500/month)
2. Accumulate cash in your investment account
3. Purchase ETFs quarterly or when balance reaches $1,000-$2,000
4. Maintain target allocations with each purchase

**Why wait to purchase?**
- Minimize trading frequency
- Reduce psychological impact of checking daily
- Some platforms charge per transaction (though Questrade is free for buys)

### Step 4: Annual Rebalancing

**Once per year (e.g., January 1st):**
1. Calculate current allocation percentages
2. If any holding is >5% off target, rebalance
3. Sell overweight positions, buy underweight positions
4. Or simply direct new contributions to underweight positions

**Example rebalancing:**
- Target: 40% VFV, but it's grown to 45%
- Action: Direct next 3-6 months of contributions to VCN/VIU/VAB

## Tax Optimization

### Account Type Priority

**1. TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) - First Priority**
- All growth and dividends are tax-free
- No withholding tax on Canadian dividends
- 15% US withholding tax on VFV dividends (unavoidable in TFSA)
- Best for: VCN, VIU, VAB (to avoid any tax drag)

**2. RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) - Second Priority**
- Tax-deferred growth
- **No US withholding tax on VFV** (Canada-US tax treaty)
- Best for: VFV, VIU
- Contributions reduce taxable income

**3. Non-Registered (Taxable) - Last Priority**
- Capital gains taxed at 50% inclusion rate (favorable)
- Canadian dividends get dividend tax credit
- US dividends subject to 15% withholding + income tax
- Best for: VCN (tax-efficient Canadian dividends)

### Optimal Account Allocation

**If you have all three account types:**
- **RRSP**: VFV (to avoid US withholding tax)
- **TFSA**: VIU, VAB (international and bonds)
- **Non-Registered**: VCN (tax-efficient Canadian dividends)

## Risk Considerations

### Portfolio Volatility

**Expected annual volatility: ~12-15%**
- With 90% equities, expect significant short-term swings
- Worst historical year: ~-30% (2008 financial crisis)
- Best historical year: ~+30%
- Long-term average: ~7-8% real returns (after inflation)

### Concentration Risks

**Sector concentration:**
- VFV: Heavy in Technology (~30%)
- VCN: Heavy in Financials and Energy
- VIU: More balanced across sectors

**This is actually good diversification** - different sectors dominate each region.

### Currency Risk

- VFV: USD exposure (good for diversification)
- VCN: CAD exposure (matches your spending currency)
- VIU: Mixed currencies (EUR, JPY, GBP, etc.)

**Net effect**: Balanced currency exposure reduces risk

## Alternative Approach: All-in-One ETF

### If You Want Maximum Simplicity

**Consider: VGRO (Vanguard Growth ETF Portfolio)**
- **Single ETF** holds global stocks + bonds (80/20 split)
- **MER: 0.24%** (only 0.12% more than 4-fund portfolio)
- Automatic rebalancing included
- Even lower complexity

**Trade-off:**
- Slightly higher fees (~$11,000 more over 30 years)
- Less control over allocation
- Can't optimize for tax efficiency across accounts

**VGRO is an excellent choice if:**
- You value extreme simplicity
- You have only TFSA/RRSP (less need for tax optimization)
- You don't want to think about rebalancing
- The extra 0.12% fee is worth the convenience

## Common Questions

### Q: Why not just buy VEQT (100% equity all-in-one)?
**A:** VEQT is also excellent! The 10% bond allocation (VAB) in this portfolio provides:
- Slightly lower volatility
- Rebalancing opportunities
- Better for moderate risk tolerance

If you're comfortable with higher volatility and have 15+ year horizon, VEQT is a great alternative.

### Q: Should I hedge currency risk?
**A:** Generally, no. Currency hedging:
- Adds cost (0.3-0.5% annually)
- Removes diversification benefits
- Doesn't improve long-term returns

Bogle advocated for unhedged international exposure.

### Q: What about emerging markets?
**A:** This portfolio has minimal emerging markets exposure (~5% within VIU). You could add:
- VEE (Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets) at 5-10% allocation
- Taken from VIU allocation

**Trade-off:** Higher potential returns but significantly higher volatility.

### Q: When should I change my allocation?
**A:** Only when your life circumstances change:
- **Approaching retirement** (5-10 years out): Increase bonds to 30-40%
- **Major purchase planned** (home, etc.): Increase bonds 2-3 years before
- **Risk tolerance changes**: Adjust equity/bond ratio

Don't change based on market conditions - that's market timing, which rarely works.

### Q: What if markets crash right after I invest?
**A:** This is the hardest part of investing, but remember:
- You're investing for 30+ years, not 3 months
- Market crashes are **buying opportunities** - you're getting more shares for your $500/month
- Historical average time to recover: 1-3 years
- All major crashes have been followed by new highs

**Bogle's advice:** "Stay the course."
